# GitLab Repository Setup
## üìñ Introduction
**Welcome to my GitLab repository setup documentation! This guide demonstrates the complete process of setting up a GitLab project from scratch. GitLab is a powerful DevOps platform that provides version control, CI/CD, collaboration tools, and more. This step-by-step walkthrough shows how to properly configure a secure and organized development environment.**

## Why GitLab?

**Complete DevOps Platform:** More than just git repository hosting

**Security Focused:** Built-in security features and access controls

**Collaboration Ready:** Perfect for team projects and code reviews

**CI/CD Integration:** Automated testing and deployment pipelines


## üìã Step-by-Step Setup Process

### üìã Step-by-Step Setup Process

**The GitLab setup follows a logical sequence ensuring security and organization:**

1.**Security Foundation -** SSH Key setup for secure authentication

2.**Organization Structure -** Group creation for project management

3.**Project Initialization -** Repository creation and configuration

4.**Code Deployment -** Pushing code and verification

## Stage 1: SSH Key Configuration üîë

***Purpose:** Establish secure, password-less authentication for all Git operations

**Key Activities:**

**Generated SSH key pair for secure authentication**

**Registered with email:** `nik0misal@gmail.com`

**Key type:** Authentication & Signing

**Expiration:** October 6, 2025

**Why this stage first?**

Enables secure communication with GitLab

Eliminates the need for password entry during git operations

Foundation for all subsequent Git interactions

**Command To Access ssh key -** `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 "nik0misal@gmail.com"`

## Stage 2: Create Group üë•
**Purpose: Organize multiple projects under a centralized management structure**

**Key Activities:**

**Created group:** `PiyushDalvi-group1`

**Set visibility to Private (members-only access)**

**Established group URL:** `https://gitlab.com/nikiimisal-group1`

### Why groups matter:

Centralized member and permission management

Logical organization of related projects

Simplified access control across multiple repositories

## Stage 3: Group Verification üè¢

**Purpose: Confirm group creation and prepare environment for projects**

**Key Activities:**

**Verified group creation:** `nikiimisal-group1`

**Confirmed empty initial state (no subgroups or projects)**

**Prepared group for project hosting**

**Purpose of this stage:**

**Ensures group is properly configured**

**Provides clean slate for project creation**

**Confirms administrative access and settings**

## Stage 4: Repository Creation üìÅ

**Purpose: Initialize the main project repository with proper configuration**

**Key Activities:**

**Project name:** `firstproject`

**Initialized with README file**

**Set to Private visibility**

**Project URL:** `https://gitlab.com/nikiimisal-group1`

### Repository Configuration:

Blank project start

README initialization enabled

Private access control

Proper naming conventions followed

## Stage 5: Code Deployment üíª

**Purpose: Push initial code to the repository and establish remote tracking**

**Key Activities:**

Successfully pushed code to main branch

Added index.html file as initial content

Established remote tracking with origin/main

![](./img/code%20push.png)

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "added index.html file"
git origin "your gitlab link"
git branch -m old-master new-main
git push -u origin main
```
Objects enumerated and counted

Successful write and transfer operations

Branch tracking established

## Stage 6: Upload Verification ‚úÖ

**Purpose: Confirm successful repository setup and file deployment**

**Key Activities:**

**Verified `index.html` file upload**

**Reviewed repository statistics**

**Confirmed project storage allocation**

**Repository Statistics:**

`1 Commit`

`1 Branch (main)`

`0 Tags`

`237 B Project Storage`

**Status: All systems operational and ready for development**

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure
```bash
firstproject/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Project documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html         # Initial web file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (future files)     # Additional project assets
```
## üîê Security Implementation

**SSH Key Authentication -** Secure command line access

**Private Repository -** Controlled access to codebase

**Group-based Permissions -** Centralized access management

**Secure Protocols -** Encrypted data transfer

## üöÄ Next Development Steps

**1.Add additional project files and assets**

**2.Configure CI/CD pipelines for automation**

**3.Set up issue tracking and project milestones**

**4.Invite team members for collaboration**

**5.Implement branch protection rules**

**6.Configure webhooks and integrations**

## üí° Best Practices Implemented

**1.Security First Approach - SSH keys before code push**

**2.Organizational Structure -** Groups before projects

**3.Documentation -** README initialization from start

**4.Proper Naming -** Clear, descriptive names for all elements
